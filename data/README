## rainforest

We picked cmr.rainforest from **cmasher** as our default colormap.
But this is not part of CASA, and would force us to use matplotlib
(e.g. aplply) as plotting tools.

The rainforest.lut file is a 3 column (R,G,B) text file created
with NEMO's mklut script from cmasher.rainforest.
Including it in CASA's color table goes as follows in casa:

Here's a script to import this LUT file into CASA for IMVIEW...
except it does not seem to work yet

      import numpy as np
      (r,g,b) = np.loadtxt('rainforest.lut').T

       
      tb.open('data/gui/colormaps/default.tbl',nomodify=False)
      cn=tb.getcol('CMAP_NAME')
      n=len(cn)    
      print("Creating a new row %d (should probably be 16)" % n)
      tb.addrows()
      tb.putcell('CMAP_NAME',n,'Rainforest')
      tb.putcell('RED',n,r)
      tb.putcell('GREEN',n,r)
      tb.putcell('BLUE',n,r)
      tb.putcell('SYNONYMS',n,['rainforest'])

      m = 2
      print("Getting %s", cn[2])
      r1 = tb.getcell('RED',m)
      g1 = tb.getcell('GREEN',m)
      b1 = tb.getcell('BLUE',m)
      fp = open("rainbow2.lut","w")
      for (r0,g0,b0) in zip(r1,g1,b1):
          fp.write("%g %g %g\n" % (r0,g0,b0))
      fp.close()
      tb.close()

      

and voila, now **Rainforest** will show up in your colormap options in the viewer.
