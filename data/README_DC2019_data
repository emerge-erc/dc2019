Two datasets marked by a '*' did not get used, although "papersky" was available and was tested
by some that it worked. The SDINT method that was 


1) M100 from casaguides
   --------------------

The https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/M100_Band3_Combine_5.4 casaguide walks you through
a feather combination. We will also try to provide this example for the other combination
methods.


To get the full data, see also https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/M100_Band3#Obtaining_the_Data

For EA use:  https://alma-dl.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ftp/alma/sciver/
    EU use:  https://almascience.eso.org/almadata/sciver/
    NA use:  https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/

For 12m use directory:     M100Band3_12m
For 7m/TP use directory:   M100Band3ACA

you will need the 12,, 7m and TP data, e.g. in NA (replace the stem of the URL with the EU/EA ones)

  wget https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/M100Band3_12m/M100_Band3_12m_CalibratedData.tgz
  wget https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/M100Band3ACA/M100_Band3_7m_CalibratedData.tgz
  wget https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/M100Band3ACA/M100_Band3_ACA_ReferenceImages_5.1.tgz

This totals 24GB and we will have this on a USB.


We are also planning on a trimmed version of these big data to immediately jump into data combination.
See http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/qac_bench5.tar.gz with trimmed M100 data, good for the
QAC benchmark. These are the gridded to the 70 channels the TP data were available as.
Another reason for this trimmed version is to ensure that all data have been sorted correctly, as
some programs (certainly in the past) could not deal with sorted differently by frequency.

TP2VIS: https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute/blob/master/example1.md   needs to be updated

2) NGC 346 (SMC observatory project)
   ---------------------------------

NGC 346 (ALMA#2017.A.00054.S), the Observatory Project with PI: Claudia Agliozzi.

This is a ~15' map with 7m and TP data, lots of structure, demonstrates the need for combinations.

Smaller data in : ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/teuben/tp2vis/N346

3) skymodel GMC fractal/powerspectrum (Koda)

The new 2020 link to the DC2019 data is via ftp or http (they are identical)

      ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/teuben/DC2019
      https://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/teuben/DC2019
      (local at UMD) /n/ftp/pub/teuben/DC2019

In here you will find the following files:

    skymodel-b.fits                  original skymodel plus two fuzzy "point" sources
    skymodel-c.fits                  skymodel with a different random seed, same powerlaw as 'b'
    skymodel-b.sim.tar               MS simulation files from Toshi (large: 7GB)
    skymodel-c.sim.tar	             MS sim files
    pointSrc_gaussOnly.sim.tar       MS sim files
    pointSrc_pointOnly.sim.tar       MS sim files
    pointSrc_pointSrcGauss.sim.tar   MS sim files
    qac_bench5.tar.gz                M100 data : 70 channels at 5 km/s for 12m, 7m and TP

Toshi's models are big, but best solved by placing them in dc2019/data as well (or a link)
Examples:

        gmcSkymodel/gmc_2L/                   an older - kind of wrong - but small < 1GB data for testing
        skymodel-b.sim/skymodel-b_120L        full 8GB multi-day dataset
        skymodel-c.sim/skymodel-c_120L        full 8GB multi-day dataset


You will find some old links (but same data) here:

http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel.fits
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel-a.fits    
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel-b.fits    
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel-c.fits    
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel-d.fits    
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel.ptg     
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/qac_bench5.tar.gz

These are from the old 4096 x 4096 models.  The skymodel.fits
is the original one, we added (two) 0.1 Jy point sources (see
header where) to check how well they are recoverable.

We have:
    skymodel-a.fits       original skymodel plus real point sources - not used
    skymodel-b.fits       original skymodel plus two fuzzy "point" sources
    skymodel-c.fits       skymodel with a different random seed, same powerlaw as 'b'
    skymodel-d.fits       skymodel with a different random seed, same powerlaw as 'b'
    skymodel-e.fits       skymodel with different powerlaw, same seed as 'c'

A newer 16k x 16k model, and associate pre-computed MS, available
here:

4) Gaussian Models (Fomalont)
   --------------------------
   

5) Lupus 3 mms, Protostellar outflow 
   ----------------------------------

ALMA#2015.1.00306.S (PI: Adele Plunkett)

12CO molecular outflow from Lupus 3 mms. Observations include 12m, 7m, and TP; here we test 12CO, Band 3.  
This has been a relatively challenging dataset to "clean", even with interferometry only.  
Certain channels behave better/different than others, due to structure, and sometimes emission near edges.  
The quality of the image may depend on turning the right nobs in TCLEAN, in addition to the actual combination method.  
But,certainly an interesting emission structure that is good for testing purposes. 
[AI] Contact: Adele

Data to share have been cut to include 10 channels of 1 km/s width for the 12m and 7m observations; 
and the full total power image.  Data size is ~3 GB when un-tarred.  

TP_12CO.fits -- Total Power Array, 12CO data cube (as delivered, so all channels)
mst_07_nchan10_start0kms.ms -- 7m-array, 12CO visibilities, 10 channels of 1 km/s width
mst_12_nchan10_start0kms.ms -- 12m-array, 12CO visibilities, 10 channels of 1 km/s width

All here: ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/teuben/tp2vis/Lup3mms_12CO_tp_7m_12m_nchan10.tgz
 

6) MC/GMC - apex + alma
   --------------------

7) HI dataset (preparing for future radio surveys)

A group of HI astronomers registered for the workshop, expressing interest 
in combining future interferometric and single dish HI surveys (e.g. SKA HI pathfinder experiments).
Kelley Hess and Nickolas Pingel are our contacts.  Nickolas suggests:
- ASKAP+Parkes HI cubes of the SMC. ASKAP cube of the SMC is considerable larger in size, 
albeit at a velocity resolution of ~4 km/s.
- GBT+WSRT cubes of NGC 4631, full GBT and WSRT cubes are relatively small at ~500MB and ~50 MB, respectively. 
The combination (using CASA) has already been published.

Nickolas will prepare sub-cubes, and bring on a portable drive, and/or upload directly.  
He also offers: "In preparation for this workshop, I will redo the combination of the NGC 4631 
data cubes utilizing the Faridani, CASA’s feather, and miriad’s immerge methods in hopes that 
will provide a head start on developing such metrics with everyone at this workshop."

8) papersky (for WidebandSDINT)
   ----------------------------
   
Instructions for this are in Urvashi's WidwbandSDINT repo. https://github.com/urvashirau/WidebandSDINT
which can also be obtained and placed in dc2019/contribute.
You can find the data in Leiden/data folder on the USB key.

A direct link to the data:  http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~rurvashi/DataFiles/Data_For_WidebandSDINT_UR_github.tgz
and untar these in the WidebandSDINT/Data directory.

9) casaguide simulations

There is also a casaguide on similating ALMA data:

https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=ACA_Simulation_(CASA_5.4)_v2

for which an Halpha M51 dataset is used to simulate a complex structure. This should be similar to the skymodel
mentioned before, see 3).

Data is in https://casaguides.nrao.edu/images/3/3f/M51ha.fits.txt
